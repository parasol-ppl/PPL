 * \section overview Overview
 * PPL, the Parasol Motion Planning Library, is a C++ library with
 * functionality to solve motion planning problems for robotics and related
 * applications.
 *
 * PPL implements algorithms mainly used for sampling-based motion planning but
 * can be used to implement the base of other motion planning paradigms.
 *
 * PPL provides algorithm abstractions of sampling-based planning components.
 *
 * - \ref Core - The Motion Planning Universe (MPProblem and MPTraits),
 *   the Workspace (Environment), Configurations and @cspace (Cfg), Simple Paths
 *   (DefaultWeight), the Roadmap, and Utilities
 *
 * - \ref AlgorithmAbstractions - Algorithmic abstractions used in motion
 *   planning methods, e.g., Distance Metrics, Local Planners, etc
 *
 * - \ref ParallelMethods - Parallel components of PPL
 * - \ref DeadCode - Code not supported by PPL (for now).
 *
 * A reasonable understanding of Configuration Space, vector math, and C++ and
 * the STL will greatly ease the learning curve for PPL.
